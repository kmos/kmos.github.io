<p><h3>Hi,</h3>
    I am Giovanni, a lazy pizza fan, which in the spare time is a developer.</p>

<p>
    I am actually working in Product Department of <a href="https://www.lastminute.com">lastminute.com</a>.
</p>

<p>Previously, I worked in R&D Department of
    <a href="https://www.bmc.com/">BMC Software</a>
    as a Software Engineer engaged mainly on developing
    <a href="https://www.bmc.com/it-solutions/capacity-optimization.html">capacity</a>
    and
    <a href="https://www.bmc.com/it-solutions/cloud-cost-control.html">cloud</a> software solutions.
</p>

<p>In another life, I spent some time in safety critical systems, in particular, I did a research work about cyber threats for
    <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/GiovanniPanice/cyber-security-and-cyberresilience-for-rpas">unmanned aerial vehicle</a>,
    at <a href="https://www.cira.it/en">Center of Research of Italian Aerospace</a>. Afterwards, as a Consultant
    for Agusta Westland, aka Leonardo Helicopters, I was part of the team focused on developing a common platform for
    cockpit systems.
