<p><h3>Hi,</h3>
    I am Giovanni, a <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y9o6frzx">Neapolitan</a> guy.
    If we follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXFpEFQ6lw0">stereotypes</a>,
    I like: pizza, football (<a href="https://tinyurl.com/y7adtzg6">maradona</a>)
    , sea, sail and laziness. Maybe it's true, but in the same time I like to code.
</p>

<p>I am actually working in R&D Department of
    <a href="https://www.bmc.com/">BMC Software</a>
    as a Software Engineer engaged mainly on developing
    <a href="https://www.bmc.com/it-solutions/capacity-optimization.html">capacity</a>
    and
    <a href="https://www.bmc.com/it-solutions/cloud-cost-control.html">cloud</a> software solutions.
</p>

<p>Before land there, I worked in many places (like bar), but mainly I spent time with safety critical systems.
    In particular, I did a research work about cyber threats for
    <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/GiovanniPanice/cyber-security-and-cyberresilience-for-rpas">unmanned aerial vehicle</a>,
    at <a href="https://www.cira.it/en">Center of Research of Italian Aerospace</a>. Afterwards, as a Consultant
    for AgustaWestland, aka Leonardo Helicopters, I was part of the team focused on developing a common platform for
    cockpit systems.
